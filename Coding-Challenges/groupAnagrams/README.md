# Group Anagrams

Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the [anagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) are next to each other.

For example, input `['apple', 'race', 'god', 'care', 'dog']` could return `['race', 'care', 'dog', 'god', 'apple']`. (In this case, the word without an anagram, 'apple', could exist either at the beginning or end of the array, since all other words have anagrams.)

# All Unique Characters

Write a function that takes a string and returns `true` if all characters in the string are unique. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This function should complete in one pass through the string, i.e. it should run in O(n) time.

For example, the input `'whistle'` should return `true`, while `'painting'` should return `false`.

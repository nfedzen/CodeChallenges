# Unique Characters

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. Do this in O(n) time.

(First solve using "brute force," which may not be in O(n) time. Then optimize.)

HINT: convert each character to a character code

HINT2: how might you create an array of a certain number of null entries?

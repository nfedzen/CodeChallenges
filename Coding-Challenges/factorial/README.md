# Factorial

Implement the factorial function. This is a function that takes a number input `n` and returns the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example, 5 factorial (often denoted `5!`) would be `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.

E.g. With an input `6` your function should return `720`.

Follow-up: Can you write this function to be able to handle large numbers efficiently?

# Once

Create a function that takes another function, e.g. `myFunc`, as an argument and will return a new function that has the same behavior as `myFunc` but can only be called once.

For example, if the function is named `once`, then `once(myFunc)` should return a copy of the function `myFunc` that can be called once, but subsequent calls will be ignored.

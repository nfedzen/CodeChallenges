# Graph Distances

Using the provided graph structure and breadth-first search (BFS) function provided, modify the BFS to return an object (dictionary, in Python) containing each vertex and its distance to the start vertex.  Start by populating the graph with vertices and edges using `addVertex()` and `addEdge()`.

The graph

```
C
|  
A-B-E  
|  
D
```

Should return `{ A: 0, B: 1, C: 1, D: 1, E: 2 }`

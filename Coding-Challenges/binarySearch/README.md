# Binary Search

You are given a binary search tree (BST) data structure consisting of BSTnodes. Each BST node has an integer value stored in a property `value` and two child nodes stored in properties called `left` and `right`, respectively. A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and each of its child nodes is either a BST node itself or `null` (`None`, in Python). You are also given a target integer value; write a function that finds the closest value to that target value contained in the BST. Assume that there will only be one closest value.

## Resources

A starting BST is available in the [Data Structures](../../Data-Structures/binarySearchTree) library.

# Find the Outlier

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

For example, input `[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]` should return: `11` (the only odd number). Input `[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]` should return: `160` (the only even number).

# Consecutive Alphabetical Letters

Write a function that returns whether or not a given string has consecutive alphabetical letters.

For example, input `abc` should return `true`, since it contains a, b, c consecutively in that order. Input `abd` should return false, since c is missing.

To run the Python version of the code you will need to install py.test:
pip install -U pytest 
To run the test:
py.test consecutiveAlphabeticalLetters.py

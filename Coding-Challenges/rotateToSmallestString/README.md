# Rotate to Smallest String

You are given a string. The string can be manipulated by taking the first letter and moving it to the end.

Write a program to determine the lexicographically smallest string that can be created after an unlimited number of moves.

For example, suppose we are given the string `daily`. The best we can create in this case is `ailyd`.

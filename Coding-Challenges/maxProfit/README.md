# Max Profit

Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

Try doing this problem without using a nested for-loop, i.e. only iterating through the array once. (This is referred to as being done in O(n) time, whereas a nested for-loop would be O(n^2).)

## Example

Given the array `[9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10]`, you should return `5`. That's the greatest profit that can be made, because you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

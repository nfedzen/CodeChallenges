# Index of

JavaScript's built-in `.indexOf()` method runs in linear -- O(n) -- time. Using your knowledge of binary search, produce your own indexOf() method that takes two arguments, an item to be searched and a search target, and returns the FIRST index of the target in the item. Write your function in O(log(n)) time, better than JavaScript's own. The item to be searched could be an array or a string.

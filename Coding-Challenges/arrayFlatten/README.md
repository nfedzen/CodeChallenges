# Flatten an Array

Write a function that will take in an array, which could have nested arrays, and return a one-dimensional ("flattened") array with elements in the same order that they appeared in the original array. The input array could be several dimensions deep.

For example, given `[1, 2, 3, [1, 2, [3, 4]]]` you should return `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

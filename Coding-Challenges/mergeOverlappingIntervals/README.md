# Merge Overlapping Intervals

Given a list of possibly overlapping intervals, return a new list of intervals where all overlapping intervals have been merged.

The input list is not necessarily ordered in any way.

For example, given `[[1, 3], [5, 8], [4, 10], [20, 25]]`, yourt function should return `[[1, 3], [4, 10], [20, 25]`.
Given `[[1, 4], [5, 11], [6, 14]]`, your function should return `[[1, 4], [5, 14]]`.

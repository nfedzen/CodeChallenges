# Sum of Array Singles

Given an array of digits, return the sum of all array elements that occur only once.

For example, given `[4, 5, 7, 4, 8, 5]` return 15, since only 7 and 8 appear once and their sum is 15.

If all no elements occur only once, return 0.

Follow-up: Can you perform this in one pass through the given array?

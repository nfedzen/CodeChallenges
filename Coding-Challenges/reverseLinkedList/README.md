# Reverse a linked list

Using the Linked List data structure provided, implement a method to reverse the linked list.

For example, if your list were `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`

your method would convert the list to

`5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`

Hint: Modify the singly linked list to make it doubly linked. Then think about reversing a list: what happens to each node's `previous` and `next` references?

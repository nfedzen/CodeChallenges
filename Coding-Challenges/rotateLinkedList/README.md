# Rotate a linked List

Implement a method that will rotate the linked list to the right by `k` places. The method should take one parameter, `k`.

For example, given the linked list `7 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5` and `k = 2`, it should become `3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 7`.

Given the linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` and `k = 3`, it should become `3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2`.
